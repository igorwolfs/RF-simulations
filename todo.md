# Simulation goals
## Simple PCB traces
- Simulate simple surface layer PCB trace, ground layer below.
- Simulate PCB traces embedded between 2 layers.
Make sure to vary tests for 
- Impedance on PCB traces
- Frequency variation
- Effect of trace parameters on S-parameters.
- Effect of different ports, meaning of different ports.

## Advanced PCB traces
- Simulate bending PCB traces.
- Simulate PCB trace with via's.

## Antenna design and PCB trace simulations
- Simulate inverted F-antenna / Patch antenna / whatever antenna you want to use for your RF-board.
- Simulate a PCB board with components on them (inductances, capacitances) including the antenna part.
