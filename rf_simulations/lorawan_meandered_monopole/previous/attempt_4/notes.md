# Changes
- Increased the grid density around ground plane edges, and long PEC edges.
- Increased space in x-y-z direction

# Observations
Resonance peak seems to happen at around 868 MHz somewheere but the real impedance at resonance is high.

So the resonance point, which is geometry dependent (and is normally not that shiftable with matching) is good.

The impedance however is too high, and needs to be matched with lumped components.

Note that this can in fact impact the resonance frequency, so you might have to "sacrifice" some resonance for a perfect match.
