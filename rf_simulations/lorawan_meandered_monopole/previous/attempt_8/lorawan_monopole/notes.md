# Antenna
Increasing the meandered distance even more to 10 mm.

We achieve a pretty good SNR of under -10 dB. 
Impedance at resonance is between 885 and 1000 ohms.

So 
- try to resimulate with a feed-impedance of 900 ohms
- check the resonant frequency
- Consider making the antenna shorter to put the resonant frequency in between 868 and 915 MHz (EU and US frequency)
