# Antenna
Increased the meandered distance in order to 
- increase the electrical length
- decrease the meandering density

Hoping to reduce the antenna impedance and increase real length at the same time to reach the desired 868 MHz frequency.

Frequency did increase, and impedance did decrease. Not enough however.
So increase the distance even more.
