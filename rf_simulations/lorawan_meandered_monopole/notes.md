# Goal
The goal here is to simulate the basic TI lorawan-antenna example, so that it fits on the board, and do the appropriate 50 ohm impedance matching for it.

# Implement the antenna on the RF-LNA board.
- Create a footprint that looks like the antenna.
- Add a connector on the top side.
- Create the feed-line from the connector towards the antenna.
- Add vias through the antenna.
