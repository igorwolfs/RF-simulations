# Notes
This looks already like something we can use more of.
Still, try to bring the resonant frequency a bit higher by
- Decreasing the width of the whole antenna a bit more
- Decreasing the width of the antenna copper traces

# Todo
We decide to decrease the width to about 2.5 mm instead of 3 mm
