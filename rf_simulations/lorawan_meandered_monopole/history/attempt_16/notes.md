# Done

Removed the long feed-line which was part of the ground plane.

# Todo
- Try increasing the distance between meanders to improve impedance.
- Try increasing the resonance frequency by reducing the antenna size.
    - e.g.: see if removing the extra meander combined with increasing the distance between meanders kind-of gets you there while reducing the impedance
- Think about adding a feedpoint short in order to bring the feed-point impedance down to 50 ohms.
