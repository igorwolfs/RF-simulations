# Notes

Widening the antenna width did decrease the impedance and widen the bandwidth significantly. It did also however reduce the electrical length of the antenna.

This probably happened due to parasitic effects in the antenna.

So let's try to increase the electrical length by actually increasing the length.

## Antenna feed surrounded by ground plane.
