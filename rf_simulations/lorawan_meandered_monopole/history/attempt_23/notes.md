# Notes
By making the trace thinner
- The overall inductance increases and capacitance reduces
- The impedance of the antenna becomes larger
- The resonance becomes more pronounced

# Todo
Try bringing the antenna closer to ground, see what effect this has.

- Expected is the capacitance will increase.
- The overall electrical length will decrease.
- This happened, however the result was an increase in reactance at resonance, so a nonzero reactance at resonance as a consequence
