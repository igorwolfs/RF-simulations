# Notes
Increased the number of gridpoints in the z-direction.

# Results
It looks like the first resonance peak completely dissapeared, and the second resonance peak shifted to the right.

So let's try to use the same grid on the first antenna, and see if the result changes.
If the result stays the same, this gives an indication that there might in fact be a significant resonance shift resulting from the added ground plane.

# Questions
- Might it be that the 868 MHz resonance is effectively removed due to the added ground plane?
- Might it be that
