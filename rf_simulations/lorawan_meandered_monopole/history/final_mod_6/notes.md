# Notes

We tried increasing the distance between the traces to see what the effect of that has. The result is the resonance peak was shifted more to the left, as expected, since this makes for antenna with a longer electrical length

# TODO
- Bring the antenna back to the same width
- Put the ground plane even further from the antenna (14 mm + the width). That will probably improve its resonance.
