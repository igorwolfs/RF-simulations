# Notes
This antenna covers the required resonance. We can always shorten it by cutting in the copper if we want to achieve higher-frequency resonance.
The second resonance peak is about 60 ohms, so by matching that peak we can indeed achieve what we want.

# Todo
As always, there is a todo, which in this case is trimming the antenna in simulation, and checking the resonance frequencies when trimming the antenna, as well as putting black lines at specific frequencies if they can be achieved such as:
- The 1.563 - 1.587 GHz band
-
