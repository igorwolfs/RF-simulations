# Notes
- Indeed the moving the antenna closer to the ground plane worsened the resonance.
- Let's think about moving the antenna even further from the ground plane.
    - Previously it was 9 mm + width
    - Then it was 7 mm + width (worsened the resonance, reactance didn't go through 0)
    - Now let's try 11 mm + width
