# Notes
Manually meshed monopole using Freecad, resonance indicated.

Next iteration: trying to create a finer mesh and run the simulation again.

It seems like because of the high-Q resonance, the result all-of a sudden becomes shaky. Let's see if we can shift the resonance point by increasing the mesh size, or whether we nailed the mesh-size already.

It also seems like its pretty easy to create an unstable simulation when adding extra points to the grid mesh. Don't really understand why this happens yet.
