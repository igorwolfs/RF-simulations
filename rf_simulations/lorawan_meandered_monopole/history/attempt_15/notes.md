# Notes
Added an extra meander to the antenna, reduced the frequency but second resonance frequency became apparent (probably with one of the earlier meanders).

# Next
- Try to bring the feed out of the ground plane and resimulate.
- Depending on the resonance frequency there, adapt the geometry by increasing the thickness of the traces / increasing the distance between traces more.
