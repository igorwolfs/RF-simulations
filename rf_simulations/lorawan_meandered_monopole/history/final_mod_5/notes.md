# Notes
- Reduced the width to 2.5 mm

# Results
Now for some reason what happened is
- The impedance decrased
- The resonance peak decreased as well

So decreasing the width this was NOT a good move, although expectations were the inductance had to be higher, that seemed to not have been the case.
What if we increase the distance between meanders now?
