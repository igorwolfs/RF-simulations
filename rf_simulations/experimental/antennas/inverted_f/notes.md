# Inverted F-antenna theory
## IFA Geometry
This is an aperture antenna.

### Feed-point
-> Very important for impedance determination, the more one moves away the feed point from 0, the lower the imepdance becomes.

Feed point determination is done mostly using experimental design.

The feed point is placed lower compared to the ground plane. Connected through the "lower arm"

This feed point is dimensioned to "balance out" the capacitance caused by the circuit on the right. The small edge creates a reactive component of the impedance.


### Upper arm
The "upper arm", connects the antenna to the ground plane. It has a size of about lambda / 4.

### Ground plane
The ground plane should be at least as wide as the IFA length L. The height should be at least lambda / 4.
If not the bandwidth and efficiency will decrease.

## Working Principle
Based on the slot antenna. In a slot antenna the current is 0 at the center of the slot.

We get rid of the half slot, it supports the same radiation mode as a slot antenna.
