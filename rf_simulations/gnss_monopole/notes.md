# Goal
The goal is to simulate a meandered monopole antenna for GNSS receiving. We'll later print this meandered monopole onto a PCB, together with matching circuit and connector, and attempt to decode gnss messages using the Pluto-SDR.

# Theory
Central idea: fold the antenna back and forth to make the antenna shorter.
As a consequence however, often radiation efficiency decreases. The radiation profile changes, and the bandwidth decreases.

## Possible meanders
Simply using rectangular edges.
