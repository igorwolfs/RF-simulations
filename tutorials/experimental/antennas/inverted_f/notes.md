# Inverted F-antenna theory
## IFA Geometry
This is an aperture antenna.

### Feed-point
The feed point is placed lower compared to the ground plane. Connected through the "lower arm"

### Upper arm
The "upper arm", connects the antenna to the ground plane. It has a size of about lambda / 4.

### Ground plane
The ground plane should be at least as wide as the IFA length L. The height should be at least lambda / 4.
If not the bandwidth and efficiency will decrease.
