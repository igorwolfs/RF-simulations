# Task
Design an antenna (MIFA, SLOT, Meandered dipole)
Create a planar footprint using kicad illustrating the antenna.
Simulate this planar footprint in openEMS.
After simulation, add it to kicad and the 

## Designing initial antenna
- Make sure to design it in sketcher
- define point to point and length constraints
