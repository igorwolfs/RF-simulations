# Dipole types
A linear conductor is resonant with any integer multiple of half a wavelength of the respective frequency.


## Full wave
The length of the dipole is equal to a full wavelength.
The current distribution is 0 at the center, so the impedance there becomes infinity.


## Half-wave
The length of the dipole antenna is half a wavelength. The current is maximal at the center (a.k.a. feed point).

The impedance is about 73 ohm for a half-wave dipole.

# TODO:
- Simulate a dipole
- Take an antenna
- Start working with Pluto-SDR
- Buy the required equipment
